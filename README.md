# Real-Time-ObjectDetaction-Using-YOLO-OpenCV-with-Python

🧠 Real-Time Object Detection with YOLOv8 and OpenCV 🚀

This project demonstrates real-time object detection using the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) deep learning model from Ultralytics, integrated with OpenCV for webcam video streaming and visualization.

With just a few lines of Python code, the model detects and labels common objects (like people, cars, bottles, etc.) in real-time from your system’s webcam. The YOLOv8 “nano” model (yolov8n.pt) is used for its lightweight design and fast performance, making it ideal for real-time applications even on low-end devices.

🔧 Technologies Used:
	•	Python
	•	OpenCV
	•	Ultralytics YOLOv8
	•	Webcam (cv2.VideoCapture)

🎯 Features:
	•	Real-time object detection via webcam
	•	Confidence threshold to filter low-accuracy predictions
	•	Bounding boxes with labels drawn on detected objects
	•	Easy to run and modify for your own use cases

This is a great starting point for anyone interested in computer vision, deep learning, or real-time AI applications.
